# ClassificationTTT4275
Project in classification TTT4275 with Eivind Heldal Stray


The project is divided into two tasks. Task one is to classify iris flowers from Fisher's Iris data set into Iirs setosa, 
Iris virginica and Iris versicolor by length and widht of the sepals and petals. For the iris dataset a linear classifier will
be used as the iris data set is a linearly separated problem and the classifier will be trained using a MSE approach. Task two is to classify 12 different vowels pronounced by men, women, boys and girls. The vowel classification problem is a nonseparable problem and will be solved by a non linear classifier trained using the MLE approach.
